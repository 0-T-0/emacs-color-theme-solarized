What
----

Solarized is a 16 color palette with several unique properties. It has been 
designed with both precise L\*A\*B lightness relationships and a refined set of 
hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively 
in real world use on color calibrated displays and in a variety of lighting 
conditions.

Features
--------

1. **Selective contrast**

    Solarized reduces brightness based contrast in general. Our display devices
    today are capable of blasting off your retina with brightness and I found 
    my eyes growing tired using high contrast colorschemes. Solarized reduces 
    brightness contrast but, unlike many low contrast colorschemes, retains 
    contrasting hues (based on colorwheel relations) for syntax highlighting 
    readability.

2. **Dual mode: Dark/Light**

    I switch between dark and light modes when editing text even when editing
    different types of files. Solarized retains the same selective contrast 
    relationships and overall feel when switching between the light and dark 
    background modes. A *lot* of thought, planning and testing has gone into 
    making both modes feel like part of a unified colorscheme.

3. **16/5 Palette modes**

    Solarized works as a sixteen color palette for compatibility with comment
    terminal based applications / emulators. It has been designed to scale down 
    to a variety of five color palettes (four base monotones and one accent 
    color) for use in design work, such as web development.
