Solarized
=========

A precision colorscheme for machines and people.

What
----

Solarized is a 16 color palette with several unique properties. It has been 
designed with both precise L\*A\*B lightness relationships and a refined set of 
hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively 
in real world use on color calibrated displays and in a variety of lighting 
conditions.

Features
--------

Selective contrast
:   Solarized reduces brightness based contrast in general. Our display devices
    today are capable of blasting off your retina with brightness and I found 
    my eyes growing tired using high contrast colorschemes. Solarized reduces 
    brightness contrast but, unlike many low contrast colorschemes, retains 
    contrasting hues (based on colorwheel relations) for syntax highlighting 
    readability.

Dual mode: Dark/Light
:   I switch between dark and light modes when editing text even when editing
    different types of files.

Features/Benefits

Selective contrast / Reduced eye fatigue
