What
----

Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) 
designed for use with terminal and gui applications and has several unique 
properties. It has been designed with both precise [CIELAB] lightness 
relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel 
relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color 
calibrated displays and in a variety of lighting conditions.

Features
--------

1. **Selective contrast**

    Solarized reduces brightness based contrast in general. Our display devices
    today are capable of blasting retina clean off with max brightness and 
    I found my eyes growing tired using high contrast colorschemes, even with 
    the brightness turned down. Solarized reduces *brightness contrast* but, 
    unlike many low contrast colorschemes, retains *contrasting hues* (based on 
    colorwheel relations) for syntax highlighting readability.

2. **Dual modes: Dark/Light**

    I switch between dark and light modes when editing text even when editing
    different types of files. Solarized retains the same selective contrast 
    relationships and overall feel when switching between the light and dark 
    background modes. A *lot* of thought, planning and testing has gone into 
    making both modes feel like part of a unified colorscheme.

3. **16/5 Palette modes**

    Solarized works as a sixteen color palette for compatibility with comment
    terminal based applications / emulators. It has been designed to scale down 
    to a variety of five color palettes (four base monotones and one accent 
    color) for use in design work, such as web development.

4.  **Personality that doesn't crowd out the room**

    Solarized can be used as a pure monotone palette, a five-up monotone+accent 
    colorscheme or in full on sixteen color mode for full syntax highlighting.  
    In every case it retains a strong identity but doesn't overwhelm. Like any 
    good supporting actor, it keeps the story moving without chewing up the 
    scenery.
