---------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICKSTART:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Put the following two lines in your vimrc:

  set background=dark
  colorscheme solarized

or, for the light background mode of Solarized:

  set background=light
  colorscheme solarized

Other options are detailed below.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TERMINAL USERS:
If you are running vim in a terminal, Solarized will run in 256 color mode if 
the terminal supports it, but those 256 colors are (in all 256 color terminal 
emulators) limited to a "degraded" color palette.  While the colors will all 
approximate the specific Solarized color values, if you prefer an accurate 
color palette you can set the ANSI colors in your terminal and use the 16 
color terminal mode using the g:solarized_termcolors="16" option detailed 
below. The ANSI color map is specified in the table below and terminal color 
themes are available for download from the web page listed at the top of this 
file, including xorg defaul color values and themes for OS X Terminal.app and 
iTerm 2.

ABOUT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLARIZED is a precisely designed color scheme with unique characteristics:

PRECISION: Solarized is comprised of eight base monotone colors complemented 
by eight accent colors. The monotone colors are specified in L*a*b* 
colorspace for perceptually uniform contrast, even when the palette is 
inverted from dark to light background mode. Accent colors are selected based 
on specific color-wheel relationships to the base monotone series 
(complement, triad, tetrad, split-complement, etc).

INVERSION: Solarized can easily switch from light to dark background mode and 
yet maintains L* (lightness) relationships in the entire base monotone 
palette set. Accent colors retain excellent readability on both light and 
dark backgrounds. Thus the vim solarized colorscheme, for example, can be 
easily modified and extended without any effort spent on maintaining the 
light/dark modes separately; the mode switch is the simple inversion of four 
color values.

READABILITY: Solarized has been designed as a "selective contrast" 
colorscheme (versus the more common high or low contrast schemes). Elements 
which are secondary in importance, or which should minimize their visual 
intrusiveness (e.g. line numbers and comments in vim) use the lower contrast 
base color values, while high value content (e.g. code) uses higher contrast 
base values as well as accent colors.

SCALABILITY: Solarized has been designed to be used both in the full palette 
mode (in text editors where many colors are useful for syntax highlighting) 
as well as in a scaled down five color mode for graphic design purposes (web 
pages).

PERSONALITY: Solarized aims to be flexible in many contexts and as such it 
maintains the common primary and secondary named colors (red, blue, yellow, 
green, etc.). Despite the common nature of these hues, each color has been 
carefully tuned in terms of saturation, luminosity (more accurately, L* 
lightness) so that the entire palette has a rich, warm feel in the accent 
range as evidenced by the ochre yellow and oxygenated blood red, 
complementing the deep-sea blue-greens of the base monotone colors.

On the name: "Solarized" refers to the dual light/dark mode of the palette, 
somewhat analogous to the photographic effect of solarization. The Ian Brown 
album "Solarized" is also on regular rotation in my playlist.

OPTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Set these in your vimrc file prior to calling the colorscheme.

option name               default     optional

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_style     =   "dark"  |   "light"
------------------------------------------------
If "solarized_style" isn't set, Solarized will use the value set by 
"background" in your vimrc.  I recommend using "background" for simplicity.
Thus in your vimrc file, the following sequences would set Solarized to 
either dark or light mode, respectively:

  set background=dark
  colorscheme solarized

  set background=light
  colorscheme solarized

The above is equivalent to:

  let g:solarized_style = "dark"
  colorscheme solarized

  let g:solarized_style = "light"
  colorscheme solarized

Note that, if set, g:solarized_style overrides the setting for "background".

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_contrast  =   "normal"|   "high"
------------------------------------------------
Solarized has been designed to keep contrast of less critical elements low 
(e.g. comments are lower contrast). Solarized has also been tested on devices 
with a wide variety of gamma values and should perform well on most displays.  
If you find you want to increase contrast for the low contrast items 
(comments, etc.) you can set this value to "high" (default is "normal").  
I encourage you to use it in normal mode first.

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_termtrans =   0       |   1
------------------------------------------------
On some terminals (urxvt in my tests) Vim colorthemes may override 
transparency settings of the terminal. Setting this to "1" changes the 
background value in terminal Vim mode to "NONE" allowing your terminal 
background color/transparency to be used for Vim's background. This shouldn't 
be necessary in OSX terminal applications such as Terminal and iTerm2.

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_termcolors=   16      |   256
------------------------------------------------
A very important setting if you are using Vim in terminals and want accurate 
colors. There are two options:
16 - Use the named 16 colors of the terminal (red, blue, etc.). In order for 
the colors to be accurately reproduced for this colorscheme, you must set 
your terminal's 16 colors to match Solarized. I list the terminal color 
values in a table above, and also provide downloads of colorscheme for 
command terminal applications from http://ejas.net/solarized

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_degrade   =   0       |   1
------------------------------------------------
Used primarily during testing, this can be set to 1 to force Solarized to 
degrade the hex color values to xterm/256 color approximate matching values.  
Note that while in terminal mode in a 256 color terminal, these degraded 
color values will be used automatically unless you have adjusted your 
terminal's default 16 colors and set g:solarized_termcolors to 16 in your 
vimrc before setting your colorscheme.

------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_bold      =   1       |   0
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_underline =   1       |   0
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
g:solarized_italic    =   0       |   1
------------------------------------------------
