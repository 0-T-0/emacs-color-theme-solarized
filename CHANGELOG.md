Solarized Changelog
===================

1.0.0beta2
----------

Changes:

* Modified red from L\*a\*b lightness value 45 to 50 to bring it in line with 
  the other accent colors and address bleed into dark background on some 
  displays, as well as reducing shift of red against base03 when viewed with 
  glasses. All instances of the colorscheme and palettes pdated to new red.

* Changed default OS X color picker palatte swatches to tagged colors (sRGB) 
  and included alternate palette with untagged color swatches for advanced 
  users.

* Removed default italicized font in terminal mode in the Solarized Vim 
  colorscheme (many terminal emulators display Vim italics as reversed type).  
  Italics still used in GUI mode by default and can still be turned off in both 
  modes by setting a variable: `let g:solarized_italic=0`.
