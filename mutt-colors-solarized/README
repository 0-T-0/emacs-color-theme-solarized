Installation
------------

1. Move the mutt-colors-solarized directory into the same location as your 
   muttrc. Alternately, you can copy just the version of the colorscheme you 
   will be using (see below for details).

2. Source the colorscheme in your muttrc. Only one of the following, depending 
   on the light or dark background you wish to use, and whether you want to use 
   the native 16 colors of your terminal emulator or the approximatation 
   provided by the 256 color values. See note below for recommendations.

    source $MAILCONF/mutt-colors-solarized/mutt-colors-solarized-dark-16.muttrc
    source $MAILCONF/mutt-colors-solarized/mutt-colors-solarized-light-16.muttrc
    source $MAILCONF/mutt-colors-solarized/mutt-colors-solarized-dark-256.muttrc
    source $MAILCONF/mutt-colors-solarized/mutt-colors-solarized-light-256.muttrc

Which Variation?
----------------

See the [Solarized homepage][solarized] for screenshots which will help you 
select either the light or dark background.

A thornier question is whether to use the 16 color version or the 256 color 
version. I have spent a great deal of time refining this colorscheme and for 
the most accurate experience I recommend that you set your terminal emulator to 
use the Solarized colorvalues with the 16 color mutt colorschemes in this 
distribution. Terminal colorschemes/values are available at the homepage linked 
to above.

The 256 color versions provide an approximate experience of the colorscheme in 
most regards, though the carefully selected monotones are crudely replaced by 
neutral tones.
